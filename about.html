            <h3>Soccer</h3>
            <p>This Barbie is a soccer girlie, she played for almost 10 years growing up and now plays on adult leagues for fun. Soccer taught her how to be tough and strong and helped her develop new skills.</p>

            <h3>Piano</h3>
            <p>Samantha Lauren has been playing the piano for 13 years and it makes her happy. Playing piano is an outlet that allows her to be creative, learn new technical skills, and explore the language of music. She also loves when she gets the chance to learn a song for someone she cares about and play it for them.</p>

            <h3>Morning strolls in the sun</h3>
            <p>She loves to walk, especially with her sweet dog and especially in the morning sun. Feeling the warm sun on her face and the quiet sounds of nature makes her feel peaceful and contributes to her mental well-being.</p>
