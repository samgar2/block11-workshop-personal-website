            <p class="pianop">Samantha Lauren has been playing the piano for 13 years and it makes her happy. Playing piano is an outlet that allows her to be creative, learn new technical skills, and explore the language of music. She also loves when she gets the chance to learn a song for someone she cares about and play it for them.</p>
