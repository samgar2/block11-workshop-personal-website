            <p class="zoop">Samantha Lauren was hired by the Wild Animal Mini-Zoo to design a project for their new intern hires. She built a page that made it easier for the new interns to identify each animal at the zoo and understand their needs and behaviors.

            <p class="groceryp">This Barbie loves organization so she dedicated this project to making grocery shopping easier and faster. First, she moved her grocery lists online instead of on paper. Then, she created an HTML file complete with food photos, different categories of grocery items, and lists of the different items. Check it out <a href="https://github.com/samgar2/block06-workshop-grocery-list">here.</a></p>

            <h3>Fairy Garden</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="fairysection">
            <p class="fairyp">Samantha Lauren loves all things magical and sparkly. So when a local art gallery asked her to create an asbtract painting, she happily jumped down from her Barbie dreamhouse to get started as soon as she could. Or rather, she floated down gracefully because as we know, Barbies never fall. They always land gracefully on their toes. She used this opportunity to showcase a magical fairy garden and included a form on the painting for visitors to input their name and email if they were interested.
